    <h1 id="title">Homework: Is the <u>most</u> you can get really the <u>most</u> beneficial?</h1>

    <p>How much homework is too much? How much is too little?</p>

    <p class="prose scrollVisibility" style="margin-top:100px">Take Ian, for example. He is a hard working student in high school who would rate his <span class="boxHighlight">study load</span> a <b style="color:red;">5</b> out of 5.</p>

    <p class="prose scrollVisibility" style="margin-top:100px">However, Ian would disagree that, with this large amount of study load, he excels in his classes. He would rate his <span class="boxHighlight">academic performance</span> a <b style="color:orange;">2</b> out of 5.</p>

    <p class="prose scrollVisibility" style="margin-top:100px">Ian also rates his <span class="boxHighlight">depression level</span> a <b style="color:red;">20</b> out of 27, his <span class="boxHighlight">self esteem</span> a <b style="color:red;">10</b> out of 30, and his <span class="boxHighlight">anxiety level</span> a <b style="color:red;">16</b> out of 21.</p>

    <p class="prose scrollVisibility" style="margin-top:100px">Now, these number's aren't actually random, and are actually the <b><u>averages</u></b> of the student's who rate their <span class="boxHighlight">study load</span> a 5 out of 5. <br /><br />These aren't great numbers for any student, and it tells a story how a high study load can hurt the studen't not only academically, but also <u>hurts their emotions and phsycological personality.</u></p>

    <p class="prose scrollVisibility" style="margin-top:100px">Let's take a look at how the <span class="boxHighlight">average academic performance</span> per category of <span class="boxHighlight">study load.</span></p>

    <script>
        document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    const proseElements = document.querySelectorAll('.scrollVisibility');

    window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);

    function handleScroll() {
        proseElements.forEach(element => {
            if (element.tagName === 'P') {
                const rect = element.getBoundingClientRect();
                const isVisible = (rect.top >= 0 && rect.bottom <= window.innerHeight);
                const isAbove100px = (rect.top <= 100);

                // Toggle classes based on viewport and position
                if (isVisible && !isAbove100px) {
                    element.style.opacity = '1';
                } else {
                    element.style.opacity = '0.01';
                }
            }
            
        });
    }
});


    </script>
    <script src="script.js"></script>

    <p class="prose scrollVisibility" style="margin-top:40px;margin-bottom:100px; font-size:20px">Student's who rate their study load a <b style="color:green;">1</b> out of 5 have a higher rated <span class="boxHighlight">average academic performance.</span> <br /> <br /> Compared to the 4-5 range, this is a drastic difference!</p>

    <p class="prose scrollVisibility" style="margin-top:500px; margin-bottom:300px;">The negative impact that a high study load also carries into the many other variables of <span class="boxHighlight">physcological factors</span> of the student aswell!</p>
