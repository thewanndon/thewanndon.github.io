    <h1 id="title">Homework: Is the <u>most</u> you can get really the <u>most</u> beneficial?</h1>

    <p>How much homework is too much? How much is too little?</p>

    <p class="prose" style="margin-top:100px">Take Ian, for example. He is a hard working student in high school who would rate his study load to be a <b style="color:red;">5</b> out of 5.</p>

    <p class="prose" style="margin-top:100px">However, Ian would disagree that with this large amount of study load, he excels in his classes. He would rate his <span style="background:border-box; background-color:darkgray; border-block:solid; border-inline:solid;">academic performance</span> a <b style="color:orange;">2</b> out of 5.</p>
