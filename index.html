    <h1 id="title">The importance of finding a balanced study load</h1>
    <p>The study load's effects on a student's well being and success</p>

    <p style="margin-top:20vh;">A student's well being is often overlooked and never analyzed. <span class="boxHighlight">Study load</span> plays an important factor in the well being of students and we should determine the extents of how beneficial a high study load is compared to a lower study load.</p>

    <p class="prose scrollVisibility" style="margin-top:20vh">Ian is a hard working student in high school who would rate his <span class="boxHighlight">study load</span> a <b style="color:red;">5</b> out of 5.</p>

    <p class="prose scrollVisibility" style="margin-top:20vh">However, Ian would disagree that, with this large amount of study load, he excels in his classes. He would rate his <span class="boxHighlight">academic performance</span> a <b style="color:orange;">2</b> out of 5.</p>

    <p class="prose scrollVisibility" style="margin-top:20vh">Ian also rates his <span class="boxHighlight">depression level</span> a <b style="color:red;">20</b> out of 30, his <span class="boxHighlight">self esteem</span> a <b style="color:red;">10</b> out of 30, and his <span class="boxHighlight">anxiety level</span> a <b style="color:red;">16</b> out of 30.</p>

    <p class="prose scrollVisibility" style="margin-top:20vh">Now, these numbers aren't actually random, and are actually the <b><u>averages</u></b> of the students who rate their <span class="boxHighlight">study load</span> a 5 out of 5. <br /><br />These aren't great numbers for any student, and it tells a story how a high study load can hurt the studen't not only academically, but also <u>hurts their emotions and phsycological personality.</u></p>

    <p class="prose scrollVisibility" style="margin-top:60vh;margin-bottom:60vh;">That begs the question: <u>How does the experience of a student's <span class="boxHighlight">study load</span> contribute to shaping a comprehensive profile of a student's overall success and well-being?<br />What is the right balance?</u></p>

    <p class="prose scrollVisibility">Let's take a look at how the <span class="boxHighlight">academic performance</span> is affected by the <span class="boxHighlight">study load.</span></p>

    <script>
        document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    const proseElements = document.querySelectorAll('.scrollVisibility');

    window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);

    function handleScroll() {
        proseElements.forEach(element => {
            if (element.tagName === 'P') {
                const rect = element.getBoundingClientRect();
                const isVisible = (rect.top >= 0 && rect.bottom <= window.innerHeight);
                const isAbove100px = (rect.top <= 100);

                // Toggle classes based on viewport and position
                if (isVisible && !isAbove100px) {
                    element.style.opacity = '1';
                } else {
                    element.style.opacity = '0.01';
                }
            }
            
        });
    }
});

    <p class="prose scrollVisibility" style="margin-top:10vh;margin-bottom:20vh; font-size:20px">Student's who rate their study load a <b style="color:green;">1</b> out of 5 have a higher rated <span class="boxHighlight">average academic performance.</span> <br /> <br /> Compared to the 4-5 range, this is a drastic difference!</p>

    <p class="prose scrollVisibility" style="margin-top:100vh; margin-bottom:30vh;">The negative impact that a high study load also carries into the many other variables of <span class="boxHighlight">physcological factors</span> of the student aswell!</p>

    <p class="chartprose scrollVisibility" style="margin-bottom:30vh;"><span style="color:yellow;">Hint:</span> Pay attention to each average on <span class="boxHighlight">study load</span> levels <span style="color:yellow;">1</span> and <span style="color:yellow;">2</span>.</p>

    <p class="prose scrollVisibility" style="margin-top:5vh;margin-bottom:60vh">Each graph demonstrates a consistent narrative: Student's who rank their study load a 1 and 2 out of 5 are more likely to also report more <span style="color:lightgreen;">positive</span><span style="font-size:10px">(positive in benefitting a student)</span> numbers. On the other hand, other study load averages, particularly the 3-5 range, report numbers on the opposite side of the overall average.</p>
    <p class="prose scrollVisibility" style="margin-bottom:20vh;">How can we use this information to improve students' well-being?<br /></p>
    <p class="prose scrollVisibility">Professors need to be aware of the amount of work that they give their students. If you are an educator, consider getting your students' opinions on how much study load you give out. If they report on the higher ends, it is best to adjust lower work loads and remember to teach your student's efficiently and effectively. Aim for an average study load rating of 1 and possibly 2.</p>
    <p class="prose scrollVisibility" style="margin-bottom:20vh;">No matter what role you play in the educational system, as a student, you can advocate to an efficient and non-harmful study load.</p>
